The user posted screenshots, likely wanting a spec for the "Activity" panel or developer tools in ChatGPT. It shows entries for "Thinking", code blocks, and timelines, with activities like "Reading documents". I'll describe the panel's layout, interactions, and details like progress time and collapsible sections.

The screenshot shows Chrome with the ChatGPT interface. On the right is the "Activity" panel, displaying items like "Thinking" steps with code blocks and DevTools overlays. I'm likely being asked to create a spec for this panel, including timelines, collapsible sections, and logs. I'll compare the other screenshots for more details.

The overlay highlights an item indicating the user was using the inspector on the "Activity" panel. This suggests that I should focus on the Activity panel's layout rather than specific code classes. I should provide a UI spec without diving into code details. Let me check the next screenshot for more context.

The screenshot shows the top of the Activity panel with the "Thinking" heading and a highlighted item, "Reading documents". The highlighted item is likely blue with white text. There’s also a list of other items. I’ll check the next screenshot to gather more details.
